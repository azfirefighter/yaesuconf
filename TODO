Do nicer labels for VFOs on FT-60R and FT-7800R

Set up altname properly and make it useful.

Decode a few things on the FT-60R:
       Weather channel
       Current band
       others?

Auto repeater offsets

I have no filter 2 for the FT-857, don't know how to set it, see byte 0043

Memory group settings for the FT-857 are not done
