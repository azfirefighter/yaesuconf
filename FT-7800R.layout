This uses the same base protocol as the FT-60R.

The frequency definition is the same as the FT-60R.

Memories are in the same 16-byte format as the FT-60R, all fields appear to
be the same

Transmit power
	0 - High (50/40w)
	1 - Mid1 (20w)
	2 - Mid2 (10w)
	3 - Low  (5w)

There is a common 16-byte configuration area shared among the hypermemories,
main configuration, and home memory.  It has the format:

	0 - bit 0-1 - Mode: 0=VFO, 1=Home, 2=Memory
	1 - bits 0-3 - DTMF Memory: 0=1, 1=2, etc.
	5 - bits 0-2 - Band: 0=144MHz, 1=250MHz, 2=350MHz, 4=430MHz, 5=800MHz
	6 - Menu#
	7 - VFO scan mode 0=Band, 1=+/-1MHz, 2=+/-2MHz, 3=+/-5MHz, 4=All,
		5=PMS-01, 6=PMS-02, ..., 54=PMS50
	8 - bits 0-3 - Wx Channel#: 0=1, 1=2, ..., 9=10
 	b - bit 7 - Wx Alert
	c - bit 0 - Auto Step Mode
	    bit 1 - Auto Receive Mode
	    bit 2 - VFO Band Edge Beep
	    bit 4 - Packet Mic
	    bit 5 - Auto Repeater Split
	    bit 6 - Packet speed: 0=1200bps, 1=9600bps
	    
	Notes: Memory bank# is broken in ADMS, need to get from radio

Hyperchannel information appears in 128-byte chunks in the form:

	00-49 - 5 VFO memories
	56-58 - Bitmask for bank links, Byte 56 bit 7 is bank1, byte 56 bit 6
		is bank2, etc, to byte 58 bit 4 is bank 20.  Byte 58 bits 0-3
		are not used.
	70-7f - common configuration data

0028-0037 - Main configuration area.  Note that ADMS sets this along with
	the area at 00c0 and hypermemory 1 whenever setting hypermemory 1
	settings, but I don't know what that means.

	    800.

00b8-00c7 - Home configuration area?  See note for location 0028.

00c8-01c8 - 16 sets of DTMF tones (menu 14), 16 values in each set,
	  where the value is the DTMF digit (0=0, 1=1, etc), taking the
	  whole byte.  0xff marks the end of the string.  First set is
	  set 1, 2nd set is set 2, etc.  Selected by byte 0042.

01c8-04c7 - 6 home/hypermemory configuration, each 128 bytes.  The first
	one is for home, the next for hypermemory1, etc.  Only the VFOs
	are used for the home memory.  See also note for location 0028.

*0240-0244 - CW ID

04c8-4340 - Memories in 16-byte format

4348-4987 - Limit memories, in the standard memory format, in the
	 order: L1, U1, L2, U2

4988-68c7 - Character strings for the 1000 memories, each 8 bytes.
	    The first 6 bytes is the characters, the last 2 bytes
	    has an unknown format, but appears to be 00 00 if the
	    data is not valid and 00 80 if the data is valid but the.
	    frequency is displayed and 80 80 if the data is valid and 
	    the name is displayed.  So byte 6 bit 7 is the alpha/freq bit
	    and byte 7 bit 7 is the "data valid" bit.
	    Memory 000 is at 6638.

68c8-6be7 - Character strings for the 100 limit memories, same format
	as the ones immediately above.

6c08-6c3f - Character strings for the Home memories, same format as
	  the ones above.

6c48-7647 - Bank settings.  Each of these is 128 bytes holding 1000 bit
	    entries for each bank.  So bank 1 start at 6c48, bank 2 starts
	    at 6cc8, etc.  Memories settings are, unfortunately, backwards
	    from the FT-60R.  Byte 0 bit 7 is memory 1, byte 0 bit 6, is
	    memory 2, etc, Byte 1 bit 7 is memory 9, and so on.  There are
	    20 banks.

7648-7741 - This is 1000 2-bit values holding the Skip field, starting
	    from high-order bits and going to low, which is unfortunately
	    backwards from the FT-60R.  So 7648 bits 6-7 are channel 1,
	    7648 bits 4-5 are channel 2, 7649 bits 6-7 are channel 4, etc.
	    (menu 40) The values are:
		0 - off
		1 - Skip
		2 - P Scan
