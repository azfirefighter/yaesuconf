This is yaesu_conf, software for configuring Yaesu radios.


yaesu_rw
--------

The yaesu_rw program for using the clone mode of Yaesu radios to back
up and restore radio configuration.


Layout files
------------

The "xxx-layout" files here are attempts to decode the cloned
information into the meanings of the various data fields.

The eventual goal is to have a program that allows the user to modify
the contents of a cloned file to make it easier to program the
monstrous number of memory that some of these radios have.


Supported radios
----------------

This software has been tested with the following radios:

  FT-60R       works
  FT-7800R     works
  FT-897D      works


Thanks

Jim Tittsler wrote a program named vxu that did the same time, but I
had stability problems with it, as the timing method he was using
caused glitching on on of my serial port.  So I rewrote using, IMHO, a
better method for using this.
